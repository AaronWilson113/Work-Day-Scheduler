# Work-Day-Scheduler

This Work Day scheduler is a simple one day display that allows the user to write down reminders or events on and hourly basis, and them store those reminders or events into local storage. The application has a number of other features some implemented using moment.js and the rest using jquery, javascript, and css+html. The starter code was provided by Uconn's coding bootcamp and it gave me a baseline header and structure to work with. The project is almost 100% finished the only things I have left to do is run some tedious tests to check for any bugs in my code and maybe a few stylistic additions to make the page look a little bit nicer.
